# are you a Docker Captain?
You already know what you need to do but if you don't remember follow this points:

* Create a feed with your contants about docker (it's really important. Just docker!).
* Create a PR and update `/feeds.txt` with your feed.

This feed is generated every three hours (0-3-6...)

```
cat feeds.txt | go run main.go generate ./docs
```

Thanks and dockerize!
